Onboard & Attach a S-Edge-Core to a Setup

•	Follow the steps described in the "S-Edge-Core onboarding" guide to on-board a new S-Edge-Core. Once the new Edge Core has been onboarded, it shall appear on the Edge-Core list with the status "on- line". For the rest of the guide, we are assuming that we have onboarded Edge-Core S/N "L890006".

•	Attach the Edge Core to the Setup by clicking on (i) the Edge-Core on the list, then (ii) on the "Setups" tab of the L8950006 Edge Core and (iii) on the "Join Setup" button:

•	A drop down window will display all the available Setups on the account. Select the setup you want the edge core to join and click on "Join". In this example, we assume we join the Setup "SiESoCom_2"
