ONBOARD AND ATTACH S-MOTE
-------------------------


â€¢	Follow the steps described in "S-Mote setup and onboarding" guide to on-board a new S-Mote. Once the new S-Mote has been onboarded, it shall appear on the Devices list with the status "on-line". For the rest of the guide, we are assuming that we have onboarded S-mote "S- mote#1" (S/N CSP-B827EB2DB0F1)
 
***Important Notice: When 'attaching' the S-mote in section 3.2 of the S-Mote setup and onboarding guide, make sure to attach it to the 'good' Edge-Core 
    ("L890006" in this example) and Setup ("SiESoCom_2" in this example)***

_The new S-Mote is now a member of the SiESoCom_2 setup_
